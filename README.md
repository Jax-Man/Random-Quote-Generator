This is a project to show my understanding of<br/> 
  -how to build front end development libraries using react<br/>
  -how to compile, push, and bug fix that app to host on github<br/>
  -and how to utilize fetching and promises in a react redux framework without breaking it. (that last one was a doozy)<br/>
